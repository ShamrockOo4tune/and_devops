Hello! My name is Shamil. I am 35 @ 2021.
Have higher technical non IT related education. I used to work in oil and gas industry for 13 years. I was commuting all over Russia (Barens sea region, far east Sakhalin island, west Siberia) 
This year I have ended my O&G carier and settled up in Kazan. Now I work in finance.
I started studying IT in 2020 at several online courses. Learned some technologies: Linux, Python, some relational and NoSql DB managment systems, Git version control, Docker basics so far.
I am married and have two sons.
My hobby is cooking. 

I am interested in DevOps courses because:
	- want to get sufficient knowledge and enter DevOps jobs, get job offer, start IT career 
	- I want to learn some specific technologies (Ansible, Jenkins, Docker)
	- to extend my understanding of IT in general

I expect from the course:
	- theoretical introduction to DevOps specific technologies 
	- practical cases, how this technologies are used  
	- invitation to internship followed by job offer
	- shared experience from the company

TIL:
	- DevOps is practices, tools and philosophy that used to deliver applications (releases) at high velocity and to sustain and improve them
	- Some technologies used in DevOps: Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Git
	- Application development lifecycle
	- DevOps metodologies: Waterfall (cascade), Agile, RAD approach, complimentary approach
